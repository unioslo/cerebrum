Introduction
==============

The DNS API consists of two groups of classes, the ones that are tied
closely to the database, and a number of helper classes.  The helper
classes should normaly be used when updating the database, as they
perform some sanity checks on what is legal to do in the database.

Overview of the database
--------------------------
Details about each table is listed in the API section along with its
corresponding class.

Important consepts:

- the name of a host/cname/a-record... is stored in dns_owner.  A
  rename will affect all entries, even targets for mx/cnames etc.
- ip_numbers is stored in ip_number.  An update will affect all
  a-records that point to this ip
- mx_set is a collection of MX records.  It is tied to dns_owner.

Validation etc.
---------------------------------

Dnsinfo tries to maintain a set of rules to preserve the integrity of the
zone file.  The database schema preserves some constraints, such as
preventing deletion of data that other data poins to, or having
duplicate entries.  Other constraints are, however too complex to be
expressed in SQL.  Updating of such data is done through helper classes.


API
======

What follows is a brief description of the various classes and their
responsibility.

You can also get a rough overview of the design by looking at the
figure below.  Note however that methods may not be 100% up to date.

Database-tied classes
-----------------------

These classes are thightly related to the underlying database-schema,
which is described in the same context.

API-users should be careful about updating the database using these
classes, as they do not perform much sanity checking on the changes
performed.  The ``Helper`` class provides methods the perform
consistency checks.

As a convinience many of these classes will set self.name in
``find()``.  It is, however a read-only value as updating should be
done through the ``Helper`` class.

TODO
==========

TBD: We currently allow contact-info and comments for a-records,
cnames and hosts.  Should we move the comment+contact to dns_owner?
Do we need comments/contact info other places?


.. ---

  TODO: Her beskrives en del om hvilke sjekker vi gjør o.l.  Dette må
  lagres en plass, trolig som komentarer på relevante steder i koden?

  Some of the things The following extra things must be checked:

  - Avoid ending up with entries in ip_number that has no FKs pointing
    to it
  - That dns_owner entries contain legal characters
  - That dns_owner entries added does not contain reserved names.  TODO:
    What are "reserved names"?  Usernames?
  - nothing can have something that is a CNAME as a target, and if
    something is a CNAME, it cannot be anything else.
  - an entry in dns_host_info must have atleast one corresponding
    a_record entry.


  When removing data, we encounter some problems that must be handled:

  - some of UiOs MX-records have no additional data, and are thus
    represented by a single entry in dns_owner.
  - we have some reverse-map ip-numbers that are not in our ip-range.

  TBD/TODO: How can we assert that deletion of data does not delete
  unintentional data, while avoiding junk left-over from partial
  deletion?


  Deletion/update of dns_owner/ip_number
  #---------------------------------------
  The following commands are relevant here:

  1. host rename  NAME
  2. host rename  IP
  3. host free    NAME
  4. host free    IP
  5. host a_rem   NAME
  6. host a_rem   IP

  host rename/free is interpreted as operating on dns_owner or ip_number
  depending on wheter a NAME or IP was entered.

  host rename
  #~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Will update dns_owner or ip_number directly.  If target already
  exists: 

  - Force must be set
  - existing tables with FK to this dns_owner/ip_number will be
    updated to new id.
  - the old entry in ip_number/dns_owner will be deleted.
  - must check if new dns_owner is a CNAME or something else that
    violates the zone-file.

  host remove
  #~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  If argument is an ip_number, this ip_number will be removed from the
  ip_number table (provided that it won't break any FK constraints).

  If argument is a dns_owner, it will remove data with indicated
  dns_owner_id from:

  - dns_a_record
  - dns_host_info
  - dns_cname_record
  - dns_general_ttl_record
  - dns_entity_note
  - dns_srv_record
  - dns_override_reversemap

  Force must be used if "host info" would return anything more than one
  HINFO record + one A record.

  Will throw an exception if the deleted entry is a target of any of
  the above mentioned records, or used in a mx_set.

  host a_rem
  #~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Will delete the a_record + corresponding ip_number and/or dns_owner
  entry.  Will throw an exception if:

  - it is the only a_record for a dns_host_info entry
  - if the a_record was used as a target (see 'host remove')
