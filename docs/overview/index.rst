What is Cerebrum?
-----------------
Cerebrum is a Python/RDBMS based software package developed by The Center for 
Information Technology at the University of Oslo. The intended use of Cerebrum 
is as a framework on which a given organizations user administration system is 
built.

* common authentication/authorization for all underlying systems
* updating data about people/organization/users in a single place

What does it do?
----------------
Cerebrum organizes the information about people affiliated to an 
organization and the information about the organizations hierarchical structure
in a structured way. It also facilitates the automatic import of data about
the organization, the users and the system itself from authoritative sources,
i.e. student or staff registration systems. The model for Cerebrum has been 
developed with the goal to take into account the needs of large, complex 
organizations with numerous systems in use by a large number of users.
