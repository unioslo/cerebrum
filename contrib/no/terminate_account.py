"""
This script removes all traces of a given account from the cerebrum database.

Use this script with extreme caution! The process can not be undone!

The script asks you to verify if you really want to delete the accounts at the
end of its run.  You have to both specify --commit and answer 'y' to this
before the accounts are terminated.

Improvements:

  - add some options to allow removal of some account attributes only?
