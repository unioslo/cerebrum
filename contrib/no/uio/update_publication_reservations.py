"""Script for setting person traits for being reserved from publication.

A person should be considered as reserved when:

    - The person does not have any co.trait_public_reservation
    - The person has co.trait_public_reservation and numval is not 0

A person should *not* be considered as reserved *only* when:

    - The person has co.trait_public_reservation and numval=0

This is to prevent publishing reserved people if the script fails to run for
some time. TBD: someone should decide if this is the right behaviour.

TODO: maybe just remove the trait for those marked as reserved, as this makes
the same meaning? This puts less data in Cerebrum, and the list_trait functions
get a bit faster.

For now, person traits are used for tagging reserved persons. In the future,
there should probably exist some reservation tables in Cerebrum for different
kinds of reservations and acceptance.

The script tags people in the following order:

1. If the person is a member of manuelt-aktivt-samtykke:
   - Reservation is removed.

2. If the person is an employee:
   - Gets reserved if a member of DFO-elektroniske-reservasjoner.
   - Otherwise reservation is removed.

3. If the person is not an employee, but is a student:
   - Reservation is removed if a member of FS-aktivt-samtykke.
   - Otherwise gets reserved.

4. Everyone else, i.e. those which are not employees or students, gets reserved.

    --employee AFFS Comma separated list of affiliations persons must have to be
                    considered employees. Employees are not reserved unless they
                    are members of the group 'DFO-elektroniske-reservasjoner'.

                    Example: ANSATT,TILKNYTTET/gjesteforsker

                    Note that one could remove statuses of given affiliations by
                    adding - in front of the status. Useful e.g. for "I want all
                    ANSATT affiliations, but not ANSATT/bilag", which would give
                    you: ANSATT,-ANSATT/bilag. Note that this only works for
                    statuses for the given affiliations, you wouldn't be able to
                    get all ANSATT affiliation, but not STUDENT/aktiv, as that
                    does not belong to the affiliation ANSATT.

    --student AFFS  The affiliations a person must have to be considered a
                    student. All students are reserved, unless they are members
                    of the group 'FS-aktivt-samtykke'.

                    Example: STUDENT/aktiv,STUDENT/opptak,STUDENT/drgrad

                    Note that employees override student settings, so students
                    that also are employees are only considered employees.

                    Note that one could remove statuses of given affiliations by
                    adding '-' in front of the status. Useful e.g. for "I want
                    all STUDENT affiliations, except STUDENT/fagperson", which
                    would give: STUDENT,-STUDENT/fagperson. Note that this only
                    works for statuses for the given affiliations, you wouldn't
                    be able to get all STUDENT affiliation, but not
                    TILKNYTTET/gjesteforsker, as that does not belong to the
