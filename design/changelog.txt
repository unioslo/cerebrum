ChangeLog in Cerebrum
=====================

  ChangeLog should be used for all API operations (only API ops?)
  that performs modifications to the database that may be of
  interest.  This includes most bofh commands, as well as automatic
  maintenance.

  It will be used for:
    - keeping a log of who did what to who
    - making other systems detect that something has changed

  Sample usage:

  # user created:
  foo.log_change(posix_userObj.{entity_id, type}, const.USER_CREATED)

  foo.log_change(posix_userObj.{entity_id, type}, const.USER_DEF_FG, 
                 change_params='new_fg_id')

  foo.log_change(posix_groupObj.{entity_id, type}, const.G_ADD, 
                 posix_userObj.entity_id)


Event-listeners
===============

  A stand-alone process CLH receives log_change events either through
  regular polling or over a socket or similar.  The process is not
  required to be running at all times.

  Calling CLHandler.add_action_listener(self, key, type=None) will
  register a program with CLH, and CLH will cause
  self.update_event(change_id) to be called whenever a log_change of
  the corresponding change_category has occoured.  This is done
  through polling/socket.

  Calling CLHandler.get_events(key, type) will receive all events
  that were received since the last time it was called.

  The key parameter is used to keep track of what events that has
  been sent to a given listener.  It asserts that no events are lost
  (must keep track of max change_id sendt for a given key, as well as
  any holes in the id_sequence.  holes older than X seconds are
  dropped).
