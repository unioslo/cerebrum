 *
 * bofhd_request contains pending requests like "move batch".
 *
 *  - account_id of "requester"
 *  - run_at not-null iff action should be executed (unlike "move
 *    request")
 *  - entity_id - identifies the entity affected by the request
 *  - destination_id :
 *     disk_id for: br_move_user, br_move_request
 *     None for: br_move_student
 *     group_id for: br_move_give
 *
 * TBD: It may be desireable to have a request_id to prevent things like
 *      "user move cancel" from removing all entries.
 * TBD: It may or may not be a better idea to store the command vector
 * sent to bofhd to execute the command.
