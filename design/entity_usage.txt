1. Create PosixGroup (INSERT)
1.1 Underlying Group exists

  g = Group(db).find(group_id)
  pg = PosixGroup(db)
  pg.populate(gid=GID, parent=g)
  # Should only (try to) do an INSERT into posix_group.
  pg.write_db()

1.2 Group does not exist

  pg = PosixGroup()
  pg.populate(# Group-specific attributes:
              creator, name, visibility, expire_date, ...,
              # PosixGroup-specific attributes:
              gid=GID,
              # Not strictly necessare, as this is the default value:
              parent=None)
  # Should (try to) do an INSERT into group_info (and entity_name),
  # and then go on to do an INSERT into posix_group.
  pg.write_db()

2. Modify a PosixGroup (UPDATE)
2.1 Modification _only_ of PosixGroup-specific attributes

  pg = PosixGroup(db).find(group_id)
  pg.gid = NEWGID
  # Should only do an UPDATE on posix_group.
  pg.write_db()

2.2 Modify both Group- and PosixGroup-related attributes

  pg = PosixGroup(db).find(group_id)
  pg.creator, pg.gid = NEWCREATOR, NEWGID
  # First, UPDATE on group_info (and possibly entity_name?), then
  # UPDATE on posix_group.
  pg.write_db()

3. Modify set of members in PosixGroup

  The Group subclasses that come with the Cerebrum distribution does
  not put any restrictions on what entity types they allow their
  members to have.  The problem of dealing with e.g. OU members in a
  PosixGroup is left to the system that generates exportable data from
  this PosixGroup.

4. Deleting PosixGroup (DELETE)
4.1 Delete only PosixGroup

  pg = PosixGroup(db).find(group_id)
  # DELETE from posix_group.
  pg.delete()

4.2 Delete both PosixGroup and underlying Group.

  pg = PosixGroup(db).find(group_id)
  # DELETE from posix_group.
  pg.delete()
  g = Group(db).find(group_id)
  # DELETE from the following tables, in this order:
  #   group_member (to empty this Group's set of members.  This method
  #                 does NOT delete memberships this Group might have
  #                 in other groups)
  #   entity_name
  #   group_info
  #   entity_info
  g.delete()

5. Population of attributes from mixin classes.

  p = Person(db).find(person_id)
  p.affect_names(LT, 'full', 'last', 'nick')
  p.populate_name('full', 'Harald Meland')
  p.populate_name('given, 'Harald')
  # p.populate_name('last', 'Meland')
  # Should remove any 'last'-name-entries with source LT, and do
  # INSERT/UPDATE (as appropriate) of 'full' and 'nick'-entries.
  p.write_db()
