Organizational unit and tree related functionality.

These submodules should contain functionality related to org units (OUs) in
Cerebrum, and org trees (ou perspective, ou structure).

For legacy reasons, some (really most) functionality remains in
:mod:`Cerebrum.OU` and :mod:`Cerebrum.modules.no.Stedkode`.  All future
functionality should however be placed here.
