Default Cerebrum settings for Active Directory and the AD synchronisations.

Overrides should go in a local, instance specific file named:

    adconf.py

Each setting should be well commented in this file, to inform developers and
sysadmin about the usage and consequences of the setting.

TODO: This should be moved to ``Cerebrum.modules.ad2.adconf``, but that would
      also require all existing configs to be updated.

# Import the basic configuration helpers:
from Cerebrum.modules.ad2 import ConfigUtils  # noqa: F401

# The SYNCS dict contains settings that are specific to a given sync type. The
# key is normally the name of a spread that should be used for sync with AD,
# but it could also be just an identifier if the sync can't match against one
# spread.
#
# Note that these settings could be overriden in subclasses of the basic sync,
# and they could also be overridden in parameters when running the sync
# scripts.
SYNCS = {}

# The available settings for each element of SYNCS:
#
# - sync_classes (list):
#   Contains all the classes that should be used as the sync class. Works like
#   cereconf.CLASS_CONSTANTS, as the classes gets merged through `type`.
#   Example:
#       ('Cerebrum.modules.ad2.ADSync/UserSync',
#        'Cerebrum.modules.instance/ADSyncmixin',)
#
# - object_classes (list):
#   Contains all the classes that should be used as the representation of the
#   Cerebrum entity and AD object. The classes gest dynamically merged as a new
#   class.
#   Example:
#       ('Cerebrum.modules.ad2.CerebrumData/PosixCerebrumUser',
#        'Cerebrum.modules.ad2.CerebrumData/CerebrumUser',)
#
# - target_spread (str or list):
#   What spread(s) to use to retrieve entities from Cerebrum. If not set, and
#   the key of the sync matches a spread, that is used instead.
#   Example:
#       'AD_account'
#
# - target_type (str):
#   The entity_type in Cerebrum. The sync converts the entity_type into the
#   proper object type for AD. This is required when the sync type is not a
#   spread, otherwise the spread's target_type is used.
#   Example:
#       'host'
#
# - domain (str):
#   The AD-domain the sync should update.
#   Example:
#       'kaos.local'
#
# - dryrun (bool):
#   If the sync should actually do something, or just be in read-only mode.
#   Note that you are still required to have a connection to the AD server, as
#   information is read from it, but just not written back.
#   Default:
#       False
#   Example:
#       False
#
# - ad_object_class (str):
#   The name of the objectClass that the target entities should become in AD.
#   This could for instance be 'user', 'group', 'organizationalunit' or
#   'nisnetgroup'. Note that the set objectClass must exist in the AD schema to
#   be usable.
#
# - ad_admin_messages (list):
#   What to do with errors and warnings that are for the AD-administrators and
#   not useful for Cerebrum's sysadmins. Must be a tuple/list with a list of
#   settings. The list could contain more elements to give the messages in
#   different ways, e.g. both logging it and sending it by mail. For the inner
#   list: the first element decides what to do, the second gives the log level
#   to send (info, warn, debug), and all following elements are options for the
#   decision. Possible values of first element:
#   - None or 'log': Log the messages just as normal log messages. Will
#                    not be sent in any other way.
#   - mail: Send the messages to given e-mail addresses.
#   - file: Put the message in a new file in the given directory. File
#           name is random to avoid overwriting existing files.
#
#   TODO: We only need to send e-mails. Remove everything else, as it only
#   complicates matters.
#
#   Example:
#   (('mail', 'warning', 'drift@example.no', 'sysadmins@example.org'),
#    ('log', 'info'),
#    ('file', 'debug', '/cerebrum/dumps/AD/log/'))
#
# - server (str):
#   The hostname of the Member server we should connect to:
#   Examples:
#       '128.39.253.98'
#       'winrmserver.example.com'
#
# - port (int):
#   If we should use a different port than the default.
#   Default:
#       5986 (for encrypted communication)
#       5985 (for unencrypted communication)
#
# - encrypted (bool):
#   If the communication should go encrypted through a TLS tunnel or not.
#   Production environments should NOT go unencrypted!
#   Default:
#       True
#
# - ca (string|None):
#   Full path to a file with one or more CA certificates - a bundle. This is
#   used if encrypted is True, If not set, or set to None, no certificate
#   validation will be performed (i.e. default python behaviour).
#
# - client_key (string):
#   Full path to the file with the client's private key. This is used if
#   encrypted is True. This file must be protected!
#
# - client_cert (string):
#   Full path to the file with the client certificate (public key) in PEM
#   format. This is used if encrypted is True. It could be put in the same file
#   as the client_key.
#
#   Full path to a file with one or more CA certificates - a bundle. This is
#   used if encrypted is True,
#
# - auth_user (str):
#   The user we should authenticate to the Windows member server with. It is
#   recommended that this user has no privileges in the AD domain, and is only
#   used for connecting to the server.
#   Example:
#       'cereauth'
#
# - domain_admin (str):
#   The user that we use to administrate the AD domain with. It is recommended
#   that this is not the same user as 'auth_user'.
#
# - dc_server (str):
#   If specified, overrides what Domain Controller the sync shoould be
#   communicating with. The Domain Controllers control the AD domain, and the
#   sync is communicating with a DC, but through the WinRM server.
#
#   Normally, this should NOT be specified, as the sync will ask AD for the
#   best DC to talk with. We then use AD's regular load balancing, and avoid
#   adding too much load on one DC. Only use this setting for special cases,
#   for instance where you need to talk to a DC in another domain than the
#   WinRM server is located in.
#
#   Examples:
#       dc1.otherdomain.localhost
#       dc2.students.uio.no
#       dc2.students
#
# - target_ou (str):
#   The default OU in AD that the objects should be put in when created, or if
#   they should be moved.
#   Example:
#       OU=Users,OU=Cerebrum,DC=kaos,DC=local
#
# - search_ou (str):
#   The OU in AD that is used for searching for all objects that we should
#   update. If set too wide, we would find to many objects that we care about,
#   thus slowing down the sync. If set too narrow, we would not find all
#   objects that we should be updating, which would make the sync go and search
#   for each such object separately, thus slowing the sync down even further.
#   Example:
#       OU=Cerebrum,DC=kaos,DC=local
#
# - ignore_ou (list):
#   A list of OUs in AD that the sync should ignore. Objects put in these OUs
#   should not be updated.
#
#   Note that objects outside of the 'search_ou' are not touched unless they
#   are named the same as a Cerebrum entity that is set to be synced with AD.
#   The 'ignore_ou' could contain both OUs inside and outside of 'search_ou'.
#
#   It is responsibility of the sysadmin's of the AD domain to not create
#   objects in AD that matches Cerebrum entities, as this creates conflicts
#   that could get complicated.
#
#   TODO: Not decided if passwords should be set for ignored accounts. Update
#   this doc when the decision is made.
#
#   Example:
#       ['OU=cant_touch_this,OU=cerebrum,DC=kaos,DC=local',
#        'OU=Sysadmins,OU=cerebrum,DC=kaos,DC=local',],
#
# - handle_unknown_objects (list):
#   What to do with objects unknown in Cerebrum, including those without
#   AD-spread. Possible options:
#   - ignore: do nothing. The OUs will not be cleaned up in.
#   - disable: Mark the object as disabled. Note that this only works for
#              accounts.
#   - move: deactivate and move the object to a given OU
#   - delete: delete the object. Note that this might not be undone!
#   TODO: Only move, without disabling?
#   Examples:
#       ('disable', None)
#       ('move', 'OU=Deleted,OU=Cerebrum,DC=kaos,DC=local')
#
# - handle_deactivated_objects (list):
#   What to do with entities not active in Cerebrum, e.g. if they're
#   quarantined. Possible options:
#   - ignore: do nothing. The OUs will not be cleaned up in.
#   - disable: Mark the object as disabled. Note that this only works for
#              accounts.
#   - move: deactivate and move the object to a given OU
#   - delete: delete the object. Note that this might not be undone!
#   TODO: Only move, without disabling?
#   Examples:
#       ('disable', None)
#       ('ignore', None)
#       ('move', 'OU=Deleted,OU=Cerebrum,DC=kaos,DC=local')
#
# - gpg_recipient_id (str):
#   If passwords are stored using the Cerebrum.modules.gpg.data module, this
#   must be set to the 40-bit recipient ID of the key that can be used
#   for decryption on the AD server.
#
# - language (list):
#   The different languages to use, ordered by priority. Used for instance for
#   the Title attribute.
#   Examples:
#       ('nb', 'nn', 'en')
#
# - store_sid (bool):
#   If SIDs should be retrieved from AD and stored in Cerebrum as external_id.
#   SIDs can not be set in AD, so we can not write these back to AD. If a
#   deleted account gets recreated, it gets a new SID.
#   Default:
#       False
#
# - move_objects (bool):
#   If objects that are not in the correct OU should be moved to the correct
#   OU.  Note that objects that are put in a sub-OU of their target_ou will not
#   be moved upwards in the base sync.
#   Default:
#       False
#
# - change_types (list):
#   The list of change_type that the quicksync could handle. Note that you
#   should not change this list without testing the sync, because when a new
#   change type is added to the list, _all_ such changes will be retrieved from
#   the change_log, which could be quite a long list. You must then first mark
#   all those as completed before running the sync - ninja-sql? ;)
#
#   TODO: are there shorter constants names to use instead?
#
#   Example:
#       (('account_password', 'set'), # password changes
#        ('account', 'create'),   # new accounts
#        ('person_name', 'modify'),    # a person's name is changed
#        ('ad_attr', 'add'),        # an AD-attribute is set
#        ('ad_attr', 'remove')),       # an AD-attribute is removed
#        )
#
# - changes_too_old_seconds (int):
#
#   The number of seconds before the quick sync would ignore the given change.
#   Defaults to 365 days, i.e. 60*60*24*365. This could be used to avoid that
#   the quicksync would take forever the first time.
#
# - attributes (dict):
#   What AD attributes the sync should update in AD. Attributes not in this
#   list will not be modified, i.e. ignored, by the AD sync.
#
#   The dict's keys must be the name of the attribute that should be updated,
#   and the value must be an instantiated object from classes under
#   Cerebrum.modules.ad2.ConfigUtils.AttrConfig. See that module for more
#   information about available settings.
#
#   The value is set independently of what attribute you update. The AD sync
#   doesn't care if you for example put persons' phone numbers inside the Mail
#   attribute, even though it wouldn't be wise to do that.
#
#   Examples:
#       {'SamAccountName': ConfigUtils.AttrConfig('%(ad_id)s'),
#        'Title': ConfigUtils.PersonNameAttr(name_variant=(co.personal_title,
#                                                          co.work_title),
#                                            source_system=co.system_sap),
#        }
#
#   Note that the letter case sometimes matters in powershell, but not always.
#   There might be a pattern in what attributes are case sensitive or not.
#
#   Note that some attributes are indirectly affected by other attributes. For
#   example, moving an object updates both the DistinguishedName and OU
#   attributes, and changing and object's name updates both Name and
#   DistinguishedName.
#
#   The sync might not have access to modify all attributes, and some
#   attributes, like the SID and Name, are read-only, and needs to be updated
#   in other ways.
#
#
# - useraccountcontrol (dict):
#
#   TODO: Not sure how this should behave, yet!
#
#   The UserAccountControl controls what user control settings we should
#   update.  Those not defined here gets ignored by us. If the variable is
#   empty, all control settings gets ignored, except enabling and disabling
#   accounts which is handled in other ways. The keys must be valid UAC
#   settings, and the values are the boolean settings we require to set.
#
#   Examples:
#       {'PasswordNotRequired': False,
#        },
#
# - scripts (dict):
#   If scripts should be executed when certain events occur. This should be a
#   dict where the keys are event identifiers in the sync. Do not confuse this
#   with change_log events. The value is the absolute path to the script to
#   execute, that is located on the Windows server we connect to, named in the
#   setting "server". The scripts must be executable by powershell, and it's
#   the AD sysadmin's responsibility that the scripts work as they should.
#
#   - new_object: When an object has been created in AD.
#   - TODO
#
# - group_type: str
#
#   This settings is only available for the GroupSync. Defines the group type.
#   Normal values are 'security' (default) and 'distribution'. Groups that
#   should be used for access control must be security groups, distribution
#   groups are mainly only for e-mail lists. See more information in
#   http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc781446.aspx.
#
# - group_scope: str
#
#   This variable is only available for the GroupSync. Defines the scope of the
#   group, i.e. where the group is available. Values:
#
#   - 'global': The group is available in the given AD domain. It could not
#     have universal groups as members, and accounts must be from the same
#     domain.
#
#   - 'universal': The group is available in all AD domains in the same forest.
#
#   Note that there are many constraints to e.g. membership for groups with
#   different scope. See more information in
#   http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc755692.aspx.
