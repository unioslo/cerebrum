Utils for updating org units and org tree structures in Cerebrum.

Modules
-------
:mod:`.ou_model`
    Implements an abstract Org unit, :class:`.ou_model.PreparedOrgUnit`, as
    well as an abstract :class:`.ou_model.OrgUnitMapper` for creating new
    ``PreparedOrgUnit`` objects from some source.

    These objects can be passed to functions in the ``ou_sync`` module for
    import.

:mod:`.ou_sync`
    Routines for updating OU objects in Cerebrum.  The sync takes a
    :class:`.ou_model.PreparedOrgUnit`, and ensures that an equivalent org
    unit exists in Cerebrum.

:mod:`.legacy_xml2ou`
    Legacy mapper for OU objects from
    :mod:`Cerebrum.modules.xmlutils.xml2object`.  This can be used to
    backport the :mod:`.ou_sync` module into the ``contrib/no/import_OU.py``
    script.

:mod:`.tree_model`
    Objects that can represent an org tree structure (or any tree structure).
    This can be used to model the ou perspective given in sources, and validate
    the tree/graph for cycles.


Issues
------
The current org unit import (and a lot of org unit functionality in Cerebrum)
heavily depends on location code (stedkode, sko) identifiers when building tree
structures, or otherwise identifying org units.

We should re-factor org units in Cerebrum so that this value is just another
external id, and have each PreparedOrgUnit have one *primary* external id
(which can then be e.g. a location-code or orgreg-id).  In order to get there,
we should:

1. Start registering stedkode as an external_id string
   (e.g. location, location_code)

2. Start using stedkode from external_id rather than the stedkode tables

3. Replace stedkode lookups with generic primary external_id + other
   external_id lookups, or just location code external id lookups where this
   makes sense.

4. Remove all stedkode info when everything uses external_id
