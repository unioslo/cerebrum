GPG data storage.

The mod_gpg module enables storage of arbitrary GPG-encrypted data for each
entity in Cerebrum.

To encrypt and store a data blob in Cerebrum, you'll need to apply a *tag* to
the data. The tag should describe the purpose of the encrypted data. In
addition, you'll have to configure a list of *recipients* of the data, i.e.
*who* to encrypt the data for.

The data is then encrypted and stored as a GPG message, with a message id.

.. note::
    Data is encrypted once per recipient, rather than once for a list of
    recipients.  This is done in order to easier remove/revoke messages for a
    given recipient, or to enable e.g. a script to decrypt and re-encrypt a
    message for another recipient.
