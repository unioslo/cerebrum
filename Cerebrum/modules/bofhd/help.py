_help_intro = """
Although Cerebrum encourages use of automatic processing, a need for
manually done modifications of the contents of the database is usually
present in any large organization. BOFH is a command-line based client
software for Cerebrum developed at the University of Oslo to facilitate
this need. In order to use BOFH authentication is required and privileges
assigned to the account owner calculated (through group membership). All
communication between a BOFH user and the database happens during a
session (which starts when BOFH is started and authentication is
successful). The server logs information about which actions are
performed by which user, and also records the changes made to
interesting attributes of registered users in the system.  This
enables the privileged users of the system to trace the changes and
thus correct errors introduced into the system.  During a session a
user typically executes various commands and some of these (and their
consequences) are temporarily stored in a way that allows the user to
retrace his or her steps.

Register a new employee and create an account for them:
Preprocessing:

1. Find the number of the organizational unit they will be affiliated to
2. Find out what kind of affiliation the person is going to have to the OU

1. Check whether the person is registered in Cerebrum
  - jbofh >person find
    Enter person search type >name
    Enter value >Jasmina
    Id Birth Exp-id Name
    *****************************************
    72467 08.11.74 exp-72467 Jasmina Hodzic
    *****************************************
2. Check whether they already have an account at UiO
  - bofh >person accounts
    Enter person id >entity_id:72467
    Id Name
    72470 jazz
    72468 jazztest
    72469 jasminah
3. Check the attributes the account has
  -  jbofh >user info jazz
     Spreads: AD_account,NIS_user@uio
     Affiliations: ANSATT@USIT, GT

This means that Jasmina Hodzic (id 72467) has an account (name jazz) with the
affiliation ANSATT, tekadm to OU 331520 (USIT, GT).
If the person you are looking for is not registered in Cerebrum the search vil
return no id. Use

 - jbofh >person create
   Enter person id >?
   Enter person id as idtype:id.
   If idtype=fnr, the idtype does not have to be specified.
   The currently defined id-types are:
   - fnr : norwegian f?dselsnummer.
   Enter person id >9090909090
   Enter date of birth(YYYY-MM-DD) >1974-11-08
   Enter persons fullname >Pernilla Nyansatt
   Enter OU >331520
   Enter affiliaton >AFFILIATION
   Enter affiliation status >affilition_status_code

Any cryptic error messages mean that you have typed something wrong. In case of
Pernilla the error message is
Error: Cerebrum.modules.no.fodselsnr.InvalidFnrError:Unknown error (a server
error has been logged) which means that the fÃ¸dselsnummer was wrong :).

4. Create an account:
 - jbofh >user create
   Person identification >?
   Identify account owner (person or group) by entering:
   Birthdate (YYYY-MM-DD)
   Norwegian f?dselsnummer (11 digits)
   Export-ID (exp:exportid)
   External ID (idtype:idvalue)
   Group name (group:name)

Typing ? a any given prompt will provide you with an brief explanation about
the parametar you have to enter.

5. Create a group:
 - jbofh >group create
   Enter the new group name >testgruppe
   Enter description >Jasmina tester.
   Group created as a normal group, internal id: 224995

This means that a Cerebrum group has been created. However, if you want this
group to act as a file group or a net group you also need to make a posix group
of it:
 - jbofh >group promote_posix
   Enter groupname >testgruppe
   Group promoted to PosixGroup, posix gid: 1030

In addition you will need to give this group a spread to make it known to the
rest of the system. This is done by using the command spread add. If you want
to make "testgruppe" a file group you need to execute the following command:
 - jbofh >spread add
   Entity type [account] >group
   Enter id >224995
   Enter spread >NIS_fg@uio

For net groups use the spread "NIS_ng@uio". Groups to be included in Active
Directory have to be given the spread AD_group.

6. Move a user
One of the most common tasks is moving a users home directory to another disk.
This is usually done when a person gets an affiliation to a different OU. The
basic command for this is <<user move>>.
 - jbofh >user move <move-type> <account-name> [<opts>]

   It accepts the following variants:
   1. immediate <account-name> <destination-disk>
      - (immediately move users home directory to another disk)
   2. batch <account-name> <destination-disk>
      - (enqueue the moving request)
   3. nofile <account-name> <destination-disk>
      - (do not move the home directory)
   4. hard_nofile <account-name> <destination-disk>
      - (move user to a non registered disk)
   5. student <account-name>
      - (find appropriate disk for this user and enqueue the request)
   6. student_immediate <account-name>
      - (find appropriate student disk for this user and
      move home directory)
   7. give <account-name> <group-name> <reason>
      - (user has lost affiliation to your OU, let someone else take them)
   8. request <account-name> <disk-id> <reason>
      - (ask others for a specific users)
   9. confirm <account-name>
      - (take a user given away)
  10. cancel <account-name>
      - (cancel the move request)

 - jbofh >user move
   Enter move type >give
   Enter accountname >jazztest
   Enter groupname >testgruppe
   Why? >Nytt ansettelsessted.
   OK, 'give' registered

 - jbofh >user move request jasminah
   Enter disk >/usit/saruman/gt-u1
   Why? >Vil ha.
   OK, request registered
