"""The part of CIS which handles authentication of Services, in addition to
access control. The access control is mostly a wrapper around BofhdAuth that
was originally used by bofhd.

Authentication
--------------

To add authentication for all public methods in a Service class::

    from Cerebrum.modules.cis import SoapListener, auth

    class NewService(SoapListener.BasicSoapServer):
        '''Your Service class that requires authentication'''

        # The session ID is put in the SOAP headers, and is required for the
        # authentication functionality:
        __in_header__ = SoapListener.SessionHeader

        # All your public methods here

    # Add auth events to the service:

    # This will check if the client is authenticated and raise
    # NotAuthenticatedErrors for everyone that are not authenticated.
    NewService.event_manager.add_listener('method_call',
        auth.on_method_authentication)

    # ...

    # Add the proper auth service to the list of services, to make the auth
    # methods callable (otherwise you would never be able to authenticate).
    services = [auth.PasswordAuthenticationService, NewService]
    server = SoapListener.TwistedSoapStarter(applications = services, ...)
    server.run()

TODO: add documentation for how to only require authentication for single
public methods.

Access control
--------------

It is recommended to check the authorizations in the cerebrum specific
classes, and not in the service classes. The reason is that we could find out
more about the operator and the environment when we're in the Cerebrum class.

To support access control, simply make use of BofhdAuth in the same way as for
the bofh daemon. CIS handles the exceptions from BofhdAuth and gives the
client proper error messages.

TODO: It might be necessary to create own BofhdAuth classes that has CIS
specific functionality in the future. Don't know were it should be put, but
probably not here.

To support access control, add the following to your Cerebrum class:

    from Cerebrum.modules.bofhd.auth import BofhdAuth
    from Cerebrum.modules.bofhd.errors import PermissionDenied

    class CerebrumFunctions(object):
        __init__(self, operator_id):
            self.auth = BofhdAuth(self.db)
            self.operator_id = operator_id

        def get_something(self, data):
            # This could raise PermissionDenied, which is then handled by CIS:
            self.auth.can_access_data(self.operator_id, data)
            ...
