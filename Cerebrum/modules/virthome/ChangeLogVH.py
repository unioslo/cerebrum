"""
This implements virthome/webid extensions to the ChangeLog framework.

The primary purpose of the extensions is to be able to track state change
requests for the database, without immediately executing them. E.g. we may
want to delay changing an e-mail address until a user actually confirms
receiving a message sent to the new address.

Each request is tracked with a unique key (they should not be
change_log.change_id, since the latter are too easily guessed) -- think of
them as a one-time password to acknowledge a certain state change. The
change_log framework in itself is sufficient for the task, except for the
tidbit where unique keys are linked to the change_log events; such a linkage
is the main task of this modules.
