        When using Action.max_freq of X hours and a Time object for a
        specific time each day, the Action.max_freq setting may delay
        a job so that a job that should be ran at night is ran during
        daytime (provided that something has made the job ran at an
        unusual hour earlier).

        To avoid this, set Time.max_freq.  This prevents next_time
        from checking wheter the job should have started until
        last_time+max_freq has passed.  I.e. if max_freq=1 hour the
        job is set to run at 12:30, but was ran at 12:00, the job will
        not run until the next matching time after 13:00.  If the
