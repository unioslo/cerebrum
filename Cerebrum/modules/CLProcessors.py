on how to do this.

AFFILIATIONS_BY_PRIORITY

    for those cases where an event can be associated with more than one
    affiliation, in order to know which affiliation counts the most.

NO_AFFILIATION
    which is the string that should be used as the name for grouping those
    events that cannot be related to any affiliation.
