Client functionality for making use of Windows Remote Management (WinRM).

WinRM is a protocol for communicating with Windows machines (servers) to get
and set differents kinds of information. WinRM is Microsoft's version of WSMan,
which is based on SOAP and uses different WS-* standards.

Our focus is to use WinRM to execute commands on the server side, which we then
could use to administrate Active Directory (AD).

The WinRM server has to be set up properly before we could connect to it.

For more information about the WinRM standard, see:

    http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa384426.aspx

        a lot of different WS-* standards, e.g. WS-Addressing and
        WS-Management, but most of the WSMan calls looks fortunately the same.
        The Header returned from this method could therefore contain most of
        those settings.

        Some of the elements that are used:

        - wsa:Action: The action type to request for. See L{action_types}.

        - wsa:MessageID: A random string with a unique Id of this message.

        - wsa:ReplyTo: wsa:Address: Who should get the reply. Only set to
          anonymous, as we get the reply through the HTTP reply.

        - wsa:To: Addressing to whom the request is for. This is since the
          requests for WinRM are not bound to TCP.

        - wsman:Locale: Specify language to use in replies and faults. Default:
          en-US.

        - wsman:MaxEnvelopeSize: The max size of the reply message. If the
          reply gets bigger than this, the message gets split up in different
          envelopes. Must be a multiple of 1024.

        - wsman:OperationTimeout: Set how long the request could run before it
          gets timed out. This is only for the connection to the server, it
          does not override the max lifetime for the user's shells.

        - wsman:OptionSet: Options for the environment on the server, e.g. if
          the user profile should be used or not, and how piping input should
          work.

        - wsman:ResourceURI: An URL to a defined resource that should be used
          for the requests. The default is a 'cmd' shell, but it is possible to
          create custom shells. If the resource doesn't start with 'http' it
          will be set up with a prefix of:

            http://schemas.microsoft.com/wbem/wsman/1/

        - wsman:Selector: Selectors, which depens on the given type of action.
          Could for instance be wsman:ShellId for Command and Send, or the name
          of the information to retrieve through Get. Not required for all
          commands.

        Example on how a header could look like:

class WinRMClient(WinRMProtocol):
    """Client for handling a remote Shell at a WinRM service through the WinRM
    protocol.

    What the client is taking care of, is how all the wsman request should be
    sent and received for WinRM shells. The standard workflow when
    communicating with a WinRM server is:

        1. Send a Create request to create a Shell on the server. A ShellId is
           returned.
        2. Send a Command request to start a new command in the given Shell. A
           CommandId is returned. Note that it's not the result from the
           execution that is returned now, the command might not even be
           started on yet.
        3. If needed, you could send a Send request to send input to stdin or
           pipe. This could e.g. be used to e.g. fill in data in prompts.
           TODO: This does not work as expected, so more work needs to be done
           for this to work.
        4. If you want to, you could now go and do something else. The server
           is processing the command and caching the output.
        5. Send a Receive request to receive the output from the command. If
           the returned State is not "Done", you could keep on sending Send
           requests to get all of the data.
        6. Send a Signal request to tell the server that the output was
           received. The server could now remove the output from its cache and
           use for other commands.
        8. Send and receive more commands if needed in the shell. Note that
           each command is independent of the others, as we need to start
           powershell at each Command request. We might need to improve on this
           in the future, depending on our needs.
        9. Send a Delete request to shut down the given Shell when done. Each
           user only have a limited number of shells available, so you should
           do this to avoid getting temporarily blocked from the server if too
           many AD jobs are running simultaneously.

    The ShellId returned from the Create request (the L{connect} method) is set
    in the instance itself to be used when sending commands.
