"""
Module for communication and interaction with Active Directory.

The module is working as a layer between the AD service and the AD
synchronisations in Cerebrum. The main class, L{ADclient}, is an abstraction
level between direct WinRM communication and the AD sync itself, trying to
handle the powershell specific behaviour, and giving the sync an easier API to
work with.

TODO: The API should have been cleaned up a bit. Maybe it should be called
ADPowershellClient, and the method names should have had the same name system.

For now, we are using the WinRM service from Microsoft, which makes us able to
send commands to be executed at a given Windows host. We send various
powershell commands from the ActiveDirectory powershell module, which are
talking with the domain controllers through Active Directory Web Service:

  Cerebrum -> Windows Member server (WinRM) -> AD domain controller (ADWS)
                 (powershell commands)
