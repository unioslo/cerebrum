"""Configuration functionality for the Active Directory synchronisation.

The AD sync is a bit configurable, to be able to fulfill most needs without
having to develop complex subclasses for each instance. It tries to be flexible,
at the cost of a bit more thorough and complicated configuration.

Each setting should be well commented in this file, to inform developers and
sysadmin about the usage and consequences of the setting.

The classes in this file is normally instantiated in L{adconf.py}, in each
sync's 'attribute' element.

You have, for now, mainly two types of config classes in this file,
L{AttrConfig} and L{AttrCriterias}. The L{AttrConfig} class adds settings for
how to set and control what a given attribute should contain, and the
L{AttrCriterias} sets the requirements that needs to be fullfilled for the
L{AttrConfig} object it belongs should be used.

Each element in a sync's 'attribute' dict could be defined with L{AttrConfig}
class or a list thereof. A short example on how the config classes are used:

    'attributes': {
        'DisplayName': ConfigUtils.PersonNameAttr(
                            name_variant=co.name_full
                            source_system=co.system_fs),
        'Description': (ConfigUtils.NameAttr(
                            name_variant=(co.personal_title, co.work_title),
                            criterias=ConfigUtils.AttrCriterias(
                                            spread=co.spread_lms)),
                        ConfigUtils.TraitAttr(
                            trait_type=co.trait_description
                            # Traits contain both a strval and a numval:
                            transform=lambda tr: tr['strval'].strip(),
                            default={'strval': 'N/A'),
                        ),
