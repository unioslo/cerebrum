Object metaclasses used in database objects.


py:class:`AutoSuper`
--------------------
Classes with an AutoSuper metaclass will automatically have a mangled
``__super`` attribute that points to the next parent class.


py:class:`MarkUpdate`
---------------------
Classes with an AutoSuper metaclass will have custom management of certain
attributes.

Example:

>>> class Breakfast(MarkUpdateMixin):
...     __write_attr__ = ('bread_type',)
...     def get_updated(self):
...         return tuple(self.__updated)
...
>>> class MoreBreakfast(Breakfast):
...     __write_attr__ = ('egg', 'sausage', 'bacon')
...     __read_attr__ = ('spam',)
...     def get_updated(self):
...         return self.__super.get_updated() + tuple(self.__updated)
...
>>> b = MoreBreakfast()
>>> b.bread_type = 'sour dough'
>>> b.spam = False
>>> b.get_updated()
('bread_type',)
>>> b.egg = 7
>>> b.get_updated()
('bread_type', 'egg')
>>> b.spam = True  # cannot modify a read-only attr
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
AttributeError: attribute 'spam' is read-only
>>> del b.spam  # read-only attrs can only be updated if they are unset
>>> b.spam = True
>>> b.spam
True
>>> b.egg
7
>>> b.sausage  # we never set this attribute
Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
AttributeError: 'MoreBreakfast' object has no attribute 'sausage'
>>>

History
-------
py:func:`_mangle_name`, py:class:`AutoSuper` and py:class:`MarkUpdate` has been
moved from ``Cerebrum.Utils``, where they were named ``_mangle_name``,
``auto_super`` and ``mark_update``.

The original implementation of these classes can be seen in:

    """ An object subclass with the AutoSuper metaclass. """

class MarkUpdate(AutoSuper):
    """
    Metaclass marking objects as 'updated' per superclass.

    This metaclass looks in the class attributes ``__read_attr__`` and
    ``__write_attr__`` (which should be tuples of strings) to
    determine valid attributes for that particular class.  The
    attributes stay valid in subclasses, but assignment to them are
    handled by code objects that live in the class where they were
    defined.

    These special class attributes are used by MarkUpdate:

    ``__read_attr__``
        A tuple of attribute names that should be considered read-only.

        - Read-only attributes cannot be changed (but can be initially set if
          previously undefined).
        - Read-only attributes are cleared when ``clear()`` is called on the
          resulting class.
        - Note that read-only attributes *can* be modified by calling ``del
          <obj>.<attr>`` first.

    ``__write_attr__``
        A tuple of attribute names that should be considered read-write.

        Write-attributes are typically handled by some kind of flush method in
        the class definition.  One example of a flush method is the
        ``write_db()`` method of db-entities.

        - Write-attributes can be changed.  When changed, the attribute name is
          added to the ``__updated`` list.
        - Write-attributes are cleared just like read-attributes.

    ``__updated``
        A list of write-attributes that has been modified.

        Whenever a write-attribute is changed, its attribute name is added to
        the ``__updated`` list.  This ``__updated`` list is typically cleared
        by flush-logic (e.g. ``write_db()`` for db-entities), and is also
        cleared by ``clear()``.

    ``__slots__``
        ``__slots__`` are updated with ``__read_attr__`` and
        ``__write_attr__``.  This only applies for classes that explicitly
        defines ``__slots__``.

    ``dontclear``
        An optional tuple of attribute names to omit when calling ``clear()``.


    MarkUpdate classes also has a few extra methods:

    ``__xerox__``
        Copies read/write attributes from another, similar object.

    ``clear``
        Removes/clears all ``__read_attr__`` and ``__write_attr__`` attributes
        in the object, and empties the ``__updated`` list.

    ``__setattr__``
        Implements the ``__read_attr__``, ``__write_attr__``, and ``__updated``
        logic.

    ``__new__``
        Implements ``__read_attr__``, ``__write_attr__``, and ``__updated``
        initialization.

    Be careful not to override/break these methods when implmenting a class
    with MarkUpdate.
