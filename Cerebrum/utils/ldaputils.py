LDAP and LDIF utilities.

TODO
----
Consolidate Cerebrum.modules.Ldap and
Cerebrum.modules.bofhd.bofhd_email:LdapUpdater into this module.

The scripts in contrib/exchange/ implement a lot of duplicated utils, some of
them should probably be re-written to generic utils here.

Some of the LDIF formatting utils in Cerebrum.modules.LDIFutils should be
cleaned up and moved here as well.
